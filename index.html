              <h3 class="page-info">My name is Jordan Johnson and I was born February 20, 1993. While my family was wealthy at the time of my birth, 
                they fell into financial ruin during the Panic of 2008. Nevertheless, my parents and relatives endeavored to give me a proper Victorian upbringing in a conservative household.
                 I was considered intelligent, though I had trouble learning at the local schools. I was suffering from dyslexia. Because of this, 
                 I was home schooled and received a diploma from a private school, which was the equivalent of an eighth-grade education.</h3>
              
                 <h3 class="page-info">I was a nature lover; this was reflected throughout my photos that I took once I became a photographer. 
                  I discovered the Yosemite and Sierra, Nevada and began taking photos with a Kodak No. 
                  1 Box Brownie camera that my parents had given me. I joined the Sierra Club in 2010.
                  By 2012, my photographs were appearing in the club's bulletin. I began giving tours through the club and took pictures
                  of the people and places that they visited. It was on one of these trips that I took my famous photograph: Monolith,
                  the Face of Half Dome. I also met Mr. John M. Watts who was a supporter of the arts at this time and he assisted me in preparing his first professional portfolio.
